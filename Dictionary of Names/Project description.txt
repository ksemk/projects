Dictionary of Names is a program that allows users to manage a dictionary of names. It offers a menu-driven interface that allows users to perform various operations on the dictionary. The program allows users to add new names to the dictionary, display all names in the dictionary, display all names starting with a specific letter, delete a name from the dictionary, and sort the names alphabetically or by length.

The program uses dynamic memory allocation to create a dictionary of names. The maximum number of names that can be stored in the dictionary is defined by the ROZMIAR_SLOWNIKA constant. The program prompts the user for input and provides feedback on the actions performed on the dictionary. The program is written in the C programming language.
