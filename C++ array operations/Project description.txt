This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates various array operations such as filling an array with user-defined values or random numbers, sorting array elements in ascending order, and determining the characteristics of the array such as the number of positive and negative elements, their averages, etc. The program allows the user to interactively select the desired operation and enter the necessary input. Additionally, the program also includes a character count function to count the frequency of each letter in a string entered by the user. The code can be useful for anyone learning C++ and wants to practice array operations.
